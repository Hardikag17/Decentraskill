One-step solution for verified virtual resumes using blockchain.

One of the most basic yet most important tasks for every firm is the verification of the candidate's qualifications and experience before hiring. The problem of candidates falsifying their information is an increasing concern for the HR department and while conventional skill verification systems are useful, they are still far from perfect to handle this.
Blockchain-based skill verification will be an ideal solution to this problem as it provides a transparent, trustworthy, and independent platform that also reduces the time spent on conducting competency checks. 

With blockchain, any user can enter their details regarding skills, certifications, and work experience and get those details verified by their respective company co-workers, managers, and team leaders with complete transparency.
In our solution, every user whether they are an employee or an employer will have a unique id via which they can be uniquely identified across the network.Their skill will also get a verified badge once it is endorsed by the managers/employers of their current company.
